## Now’s the time to get started with ShareGro

Investing your money sooner, even in small amounts, typically means you’ll end up with more than if you start with larger amounts later. That can lead to more financial freedom and hopefully, happiness.

### Investing shouldn’t be intimidating

Let’s face it: the idea of investing can seem pretty daunting to a lot of people. You know you should invest, but you’re not sure how to do it. Or even when to get started. Luckily, the answers to both questions may be easier than you think.

### Knowledge is power

ShareGro aims to make all aspects of investing simple to understand. We’re demystifying the process because we believe education leads to empowered investors. And an empowered investor is more likely to achieve financial freedom than one who is not.

### Investment strategy in about 60 seconds

So. Back to the question of when you should start investing. The short answer: typically the sooner, the better. You might be ready to get started if you:

- Want to increase your spending budget over time
- Are able to plan future purchases (for travel, service, etc.)
- Are researching ways your spending can benefit you financially

And investing even a little now can go a long way later. To see what we mean, check out our video which makes basic investment strategy as non-intimidating as a forest of majestic trees (no, really).
